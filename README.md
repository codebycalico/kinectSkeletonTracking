# Skeleton Tracking with Microsoft's Kinect
## Code by Calico Randall (with help from Internet sources and classmates)

This is a "simple" Java code created in Processings's IDE using Open Sound Control (OSC) to gather te data collected through the Kinect and translate it into coordinates that can be used in code to visualize and make use of the human body's movements. I have used this code and created different versions and variations for various uses and art projects.
